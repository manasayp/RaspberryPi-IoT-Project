# RaspberryPi-IoT-Project
IoT Course Project -COEN296
A temperature graph is implemented using dygraphs which reads from a DHT11 temperature sensor.
Temperature reading is recorded using RaspberryPi and Python Libraries.
Hardware/Software :  Marvell IoT starter kit,AWS IoT and AWS DynamoDB

Implementation of a Motion detection alert system using Intel LibUPM library
Hardware : RaspberryPi 2, Grove Motion Sensor Software/Libraries: Dygraphs, Apache Webserver, LibUPM, LibMRAA
